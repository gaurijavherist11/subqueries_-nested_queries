# üîç Advanced SQL Queries: Subqueries Practice

This section demonstrates the use of **scalar**, **correlated**, and **set-based subqueries** to extract complex insights from a relational database.

## üß† Subquery Types Covered

### 1. Scalar Subqueries
- Returns a **single value**.
- Used in `WHERE`, `SELECT`, or `HAVING` clauses.
- Example use: Finding customers who made the highest payment.

### 2. Correlated Subqueries
- Uses data from the outer query.
- Runs **once per row** of the outer query.
- Example use: Calculating total amount paid by the same customer in another table.

### 3. Subqueries with `IN`, `EXISTS`, `=`
- `IN`: Used to match values in a list returned by a subquery.
- `EXISTS`: Checks if a subquery returns **any** row.
- `=`: When comparing to a scalar subquery result.


## ‚úÖ Outcome

By practicing these subqueries, the following advanced SQL logic skills were developed:
- Writing dynamic filters based on subquery results.
- Understanding query nesting and performance.
- Solving business questions involving multi-level logic.

These skills are essential for roles in data analysis, reporting, and backend logic design.
